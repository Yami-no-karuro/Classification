# C - Classification 

## Binary Classification (Naive Bayes classifier), in C

### Intro

**Classification** teaches a machine to sort things into categories.  
It learns by looking at examples with labels (like emails marked “spam” or “not spam”).  
After learning, it can decide which category new items belong to, like identifying if a new email is spam or not.  
**Classification**, like **Linear Regression** is a type of **Supervised Learning Algorithm** that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets.  
(More on [Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and [Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification) on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/))

### What is this example about?

In this example we'll take a look at **Binary Classification**, the simplest form of **Classification**.  
We will implement a **Naive Bayes Classifier** for a simple spam filter.
